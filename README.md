# Project Overview

In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company, leaving me with an application with an incomplete test suite.


## What I Learned

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. They test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## Running Instructions

1. Click on "Clone or Download" on this repository page to download .zip file.
2. Extract the folder contents and open "index.html" in a browser to run the application.
3. At the bottom of the screen, you will find the Jasmine test results. Tests appear in green if passed and red if failed.
